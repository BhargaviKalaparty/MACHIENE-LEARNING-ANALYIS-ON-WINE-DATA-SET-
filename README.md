# MACHIENE-LEARNING-ANALYIS-ON-WINE-DATA-SET

# About:

Data clustering and classification is performed on the dataset, clustering methods: KMeans, Agglomerative Clustering, DBSCAN, Gaussian Mixture Model, Affinity Propagation and BIRCH. Classification methods: SVM, Decision Trees, KNN, Gradient Boost, Random Forest and AdaBoost. 
Evaluation on all models is done by checking accuracy, precision score, recall score, F1 and ROC and best model is selected.

# Dataset: 
Scikit-learn provides several datasets, including the Wine dataset. The dataset typically includes a set of attributes or features that describe various chemical properties of the wines. These features can include things like alcohol content, acidity, color intensity ETC. This dataset can be directly loaded from the module of Scikit-learn by using load_wine.

# Python libraries used:

Numpy, matplotlib, seaborn and sklearn.
